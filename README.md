### What is this?
- This is a small audio library that as of now supports OggVorbis through the Vorbisfile library, wav through a simple selfmade wav reader and mp3 through the MiniMp3 lib. AudioDevice handling is done through OpenAL so it should be both Windows and Linux compatible.

### Why bother?
- Good question. The core idea is to provide a simple wrapper for OpenAL with a little extra functionallity and at the same time, I intend to use it for a small and simple game engine (mainly for 2D)
