# TODO
- Setup milestones.
- Add mp3 decoding
- Add licence and code of conduct
- Remind myself that memcpy is great, just not when combining byte...
- Add mp3 CRC decoding - (Hate having to work with a 35 bit value...)
- Remind myself that bits are fun, until you read them wrong and wonder where in the *redacted* code it went wrong
