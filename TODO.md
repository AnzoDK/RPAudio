# TODO
- Setup milestones.
- ~~Add mp3 decoding~~ Done (Through MiniMp3 - planning on making my own decoder in the future)
- Add licence and code of conduct
- Remind myself that memcpy is great, just not when combining byte...
- ~~Add mp3 CRC decoding - (Hate having to work with a 35 bit value...)~~ Done (Same as goal 2)
- Remind myself that bits are fun, until you read them wrong and wonder where in the *redacted* code it went wrong
- ~~Add support for mp3 extensions (instead of just ignoring them...)~~ Done (Same as goal 2)
- ~~add Mp3 bitrate lookuptable based on http://mpgedit.org/mpgedit/mpeg_format/MP3Format.html~~ Done (Same as goal 2)
