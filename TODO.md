# TODO
- Setup milestones.
- Add mp3 decoding
- Add licence and code of conduct
- Remind myself that memcpy is great, just not when combining byte...
- Add mp3 CRC decoding - (Hate having to work with a 35 bit value...)
- Remind myself that bits are fun, until you read them wrong and wonder where in the *redacted* code it went wrong
- add support for mp3 extensions (instead of just ignoring them...)
- add Mp3 bitrate lookuptable based on http://mpgedit.org/mpgedit/mpeg_format/MP3Format.html
